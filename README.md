# üíª macbookair52-reoptimize

Power, performance, and thermal tuning scripts for **MacBookAir5,2** running **Arch Linux**.

- ‚úÖ Uses TLP for advanced power management
- ‚úÖ Runs `powertop --auto-tune` on boot
- ‚úÖ Manages fan and thermals with `macfanctld` and `thermald`
- ‚úÖ Auto-reoptimizes after kernel updates via systemd and pacman hook

---

## üöÄ Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digidude512/macbookair52-reoptimize.git
cd macbookair52-reoptimize
chmod +x install.sh reoptimize-macbook.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

---

## üßº Cleanup (Optional)

If you've previously installed an older version of the optimization scripts manually, run this first to clean it up safely:

```bash
chmod +x cleanup-old-macbook-opt.sh
./cleanup-old-macbook-opt.sh
```

This will:
- Backup your existing `tlp.conf` and optimization script
- Remove old systemd services/timers
- Remove the pacman hook and reoptimize script

Then re-run the install:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

---

## üîÅ Reoptimization

After every kernel update (or once a week via timer), this script is run:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/reoptimize-macbook.sh
```

It reapplies:
- TLP tuning
- `powertop --auto-tune` runtime settings
